# Project Rules (AGENTS.md)

- Prefer reading and searching before editing.
- When changing code, keep diffs small and well-scoped.
- Always run a minimal verification step (tests / lint) when possible.
- Do not fabricate outputs: use tools.

## Repository notes
- Project root is the current working directory (cwd).
